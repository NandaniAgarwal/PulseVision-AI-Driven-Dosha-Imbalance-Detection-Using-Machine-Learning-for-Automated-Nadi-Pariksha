# PulseVision-AI-Driven-Dosha-Imbalance-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-for-Automated-Nadi-Pariksha
PulseVision is an AI-powered system that modernizes Ayurvedic Nadi Pariksha by analyzing pulse signals with machine learning to detect dosha imbalances (Vata, Pitta, Kapha), aiding in early health diagnosis and personalized wellness insights.
The project involves preprocessing raw pulse signals to remove noise, applying feature engineering methods to capture important time and frequency domain characteristics, and training multiple machine learning models to classify dosha types. By integrating signal processing with predictive modeling, PulseVision offers a data-driven approach to traditional diagnostics, promoting early detection of health issues and enabling personalized wellness recommendations. The project not only bridges ancient medical wisdom with modern AI technologies but also lays the groundwork for future expansion into real-time IoT-based monitoring and mobile health applications, making holistic healthcare more accessible, precise, and technology-driven.
